        <p>Here are some things I've liked recently that I want to share :)</p>
        <hr>
        <p>This picture is the poster for a <span>sci-fi show</span> I've been watching for the last week or so.<br>
          It involves the investigation of pieces of an <em>alien ship</em> that fall to Earth and have different, <em>usually strange</em>, effects on the people that find it.<br>
          The premise is interesting and things keep ramping up, which makes it highly entertaining.
